  <h1>Global Terrorist Attacks Analysis (1970-2020)</h1>
  
  **_Project Overview:_**

  This project aims to analyze and visualize data on terrorist attacks, which have had a significant impact on global security and economic development. 
  Terrorist activities have been on the rise in recent years, leading to increased instability and disruption of economic progress. 
  Understanding the frequency, location, and types of terrorist attacks is crucial for predicting future incidents and strategizing security responses.

  The dataset used in this project is an open-source, global dataset that spans the years 1970 to 2020, containing information on over 200,000 terrorist events. 
  The goal of this project is to visualize key aspects of this dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations, such as the geographical distribution of attacks,
  the most common types of attacks, and the overall frequency of incidents over time.
  
  By performing data analysis, this project will provide valuable insights into the global patterns of terrorism, helping to predict potential future attacks and identify regions most at risk. 
  This information can be used by policymakers, security agencies, and organizations to implement more effective counterterrorism strategies and improve global security measures.
